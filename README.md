Game Zone is a JavaFX-based multi-game app that lets users play multiple mini-games from one interface. It uses strong OOP design, modular structure, scene navigation, and event-driven programming. The app includes three games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Snake, and Hangman, and can be easily expanded in the future.
